> üõë **WARNING**: Velen is currently relying on the development version of Javacord, as I do not know when the patch will be released, I decided to release the framework's version 3.0.0 officially while requiring the Development Version of Javacord (3.4.0-SNAPSHOT). Please use the SNAPSHOT version of Javacord instead which can be found on [their wiki](https://javacord.org/wiki/getting-started/download-installation.html#gradle-2)

Aiming to become the Laravel of Javacord; Velen is a framework for Discord bots using Javacord with complete features from hybrid (message and slash commands), slash commands, prefix managers, blacklists, fuzzy command search, cooldowns and many more. The aim of Velen is to reduce the time it takes for developers to setup a Discord bot without compromising on performance.

For a more organized look-through at Velen, please check our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Velen/wiki) instead
where everything is more organized and easier to read.

- More to be added, feel free to create an issue if you want to add yours here!

## üîÆ Version Policy
Velen has a specific version policy, in which, unless there is a critical change to be made, an update will only be released on
either of these conditions (this is to prevent me from overworking):
- 3+ issues (bug fixes, feature requests, improvements, etc).
- A critical bug fix.
- A new Javacord update.

The library also follows a similar version number policy with Javacord:
- A change in the first digit of the version will mean: **major update or two-three major breaking change**.
- A change in the second digit of the version will mean: **a large quantity of __accumulated__ updates or a breaking change**.
- A change in the last digit of the version will mean: **a minor update, usually new features or fixes**.
