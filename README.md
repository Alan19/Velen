Velen is a command framework (or library) that is created mainly for Javacord with the aim to make everything more easier
and faster to create, for example, slash commands, hybrid commands, cooldowns (rate-limiters), per-server prefixes, pagination and more!

For a more organized look-through at Velen, please check our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Velen/wiki) instead
where everything is more organized and easier to read.

## üîå Requirements
Velen only has one requirements and that is the latest Javacord, this will be
updated everytime Javacord releases a new patch. Please ensure your Javacord version
will be always up-to-date when using Velen!
- Javacord v3.3.2

## ‚úîÔ∏è Ping-Pong Example
A very simple of a ping-pong command in Velen is:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder().setDefaultPrefix("v.").build();
VelenCommand.of("ping", velen, (event, message, user, args) -> message.reply("Pong!")).attach();

DiscordApi api = new DiscordApiBuilder().setToken(token)
                 .addListener(velen).login().join();
```

An example of slash command in Velen is:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder().setDefaultPrefix("v.").build();
VelenCommand.ofSlash("velenSlash", "A normal velen slash command.", velen, (event, user, args, options, firstResponder) -> 
          firstResponder.setContent("Hello!").respond()).attach();

DiscordApi api = new DiscordApiBuilder().setToken(token)
                 .addListener(velen).login().join();
```

An example of a hybrid command in Velen is:
```java
VelenCommand.ofHybrid("velenHybrid", "A velen hybrid command!", velen, 
                (event, message, user, args) -> message.reply("Hello!"),
                (event, user, args1, options, firstResponder) -> firstResponder.setContent("Hello").respond())
                .attach();
```

You can place the event handlers on their own classes, as well. If you want to learn more about those,
feel free to look at our Wiki where we explain everything more in detail: 
- [Slash Commands and Hybrid Commands](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Velen/wiki/Building-Slash-&-Hybrid-Commands!)
- [Message Commands](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Velen/wiki/Building-Commands!)

You can also check out our example bot that utilizes Velen `v2.0` and Javacord `v3.3.2` paired with Redis to create
a persistent per-server prefix and blacklist:

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Installation
You can easily install Velen through Maven Central by adding these entries onto your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`:

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>pw.mihou</groupId>
  <artifactId>Velen</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
implementation 'pw.mihou:Velen:2.1.1'
```

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Velen is used by
- [Amelia](https://github.com/ManaNet/Amelia): A Discord bot that is dedicated to a webnovel site called ScribbleHub.
- More to be added, feel free to create an issue if you want to add yours here!

## üîÆ Version Policy
Velen has a specific version policy, in which, unless there is a critical change to be made, an update will only be released on
either of these conditions (this is to prevent me from overworking):
- 3+ issues (bug fixes, feature requests, improvements, etc).
- A critical bug fix.
- A new Javacord update.

The library also follows a similar version number policy with Javacord:
- A change in the first digit of the version will mean: **major update or two-three major breaking change**.
- A change in the second digit of the version will mean: **a large quantity of __accumulated__ updates or a breaking change**.
- A change in the last digit of the version will mean: **a minor update, usually new features or fixes**.

## üèéÔ∏è How does Velen work?
Velen functions through a single class that acts as the processor of the events, it handles and dispatches
the events accordingly to the command that was invoked, for example, if a command with the name `help` was invoked
and received by Velen. It will start to look for the command `help` to see if it is registered or not and if it
is then it will trigger that event in an **asynchronous** manner, which means all the events are handled in
different threads.
