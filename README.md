Velen is a command framework that is created for Javacord, it aims to be simple to understand and
easy to create like the library it is using.

## üì¶ How many components does Velen have?
Velen has several components: `VelenRateLimiter`, `VelenCommand`, `VelenPrefixManager` and the main `Velen` component
which is the core. Each of the components have their own uses and is decently flexible to use for many situations.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Installation
You can easily install Velen through Maven Central by adding these entries onto your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`:

**pom.xml**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>pw.mihou</groupId>
  <artifactId>Velen</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

**build.gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'pw.mihou:Velen:1.0.2'
```

## ‚åõ Velen Rate Limiter
The cooldown handler for Velen, this is an extremely simple implementation and doesn't have much settings other than
being able to change the duration of the cooldown, the message of the cooldown (which is done when building Velen). You
can change the cooldown of Velen and the message by modifying them during build, for example:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder()
                .setDefaultCooldownTime(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .setRatelimitedMessage((remainingSeconds, user, channel, command) -> 
                    "You are currently rate-limited for " + remainingSeconds + " seconds.");
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Velen Prefix Manager
This component is in charge of providing prefixes to all the servers whether it'd be a per-server prefix or a single 
prefix for all servers, by default, all servers uses the prefix `v.` but that is easily changeable through the builder.
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder().setDefaultPrefix("v.");
```

If you want to use per-server prefixes, you need to have a database where you store the prefixes per-server, for example,
Redis or MongoDB then Velen will handle the storing of the prefixes locally, an example is:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder().setPrefixManager(new VelenPrefixManager("v.", 
                        key -> MongoDB.collection("servers", "prefixes")
                               .find(Filters.eq("server", key)).first()
                                .getString("prefix")));
```

The example above uses MongoDB (with a helper class), the flow of the prefix manager would then become like this:
`Check if prefix already exists on local application memory` -> `if not, fetch through MongoDB`

The loader is also not just limited to external databases, in fact, you can even use a `HashMap<Long, String>` and
store stuff there but database is recommended for persistence.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Velen Component
The Velen component is, by far, the simplest to make with the exception of `PrefixManager` and `Ratelimiter` with
an example of creating the component being:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.builder()
  // Sets the default cooldown time of the command if no cooldown is specified.
  .setDefaultCooldownTime(Duration.ofSeconds(10))

  // Sets the default prefix that Velen will use (this will be overriden by Prefix Manager).
  .setDefaultPrefix("v.")

  // Sets the message to be sent once every ratelimit cycle if the user is rate-limited.
  .setRatelimitedMessage((remainingSeconds, user, channel, command) -> "You are currently rate-limited for " + remainingSeconds + " seconds.")

  // Set the message to be sent if the user doesn't have all the permissions needed to use the command. (default)
  .setNoPermissionMessage((permission, user, channel, command) -> "You need the permission(s): " + permission.stream()
    .map(Enum::name).collect(Collectors.joining(",")) + " to use this command!")

  // Set the message to be sent if the user doesn't have the proper roles to use the command. (default)
  .setNoRoleMessage((roles, user, channel, command) -> "You need the role(s): " + roles + " to use this command!")

  // Sets the prefix manager which is a more advanced default prefix which allows you to fetch
  // prefixes from a database for per-server prefixes, example below.
  // Key is equals to the server id, you should only use this if you are using a database to store
  // per-server prefixes.
  .setPrefixManager(new VelenPrefixManager("v.", key -> prefixes.get(key)))
  .build();
```

You can also use the default settings of Velen which can be retrieved through the one-liner method:
```java
Velen velen = Velen.ofDefaults();
```

After building the Velen instance, you can then attach it to your DiscordApi instance through the following:
```java
DiscordApi api = new DiscordApiBuilder()
                .setToken(token)
                .setAllIntents()
                .addListener(velen)
                .login()
                .join();
```

## üó®Ô∏è Velen Message Component
This is the part of Velen where you can customize the no permission, no role and rate-limited message as seen on the example
below. To modify the `no permission` message, you can simply create an `VelenPermissionMessage` which would give you the following
parameters: `(List<PermissionType> permission, User user, TextChannel channel, String command)` which you can easily turn into a 
message like this:
```java
Velen.builder().setNoPermissionMessage((permission, user, channel, command) -> "You need the permission(s): " + permission.stream()
                     .map(Enum::name).collect(Collectors.joining(",")) + " to use this command!");
```

An `VelenRoleMessage` which is used for no role messages gives you the parameters `(String roles, User user, TextChannel channel, String command)`
which is nearly identical to the `VelenPermissionMessage` with the exception of the roles being in String format (pre-formatted to mention the roles,
they won't ping or mention the users who have the role since they are sent with a MessageBuilder with no mentions allowed), the default message is:
```java
Velen.builder().setNoRoleMessage((roles, user, channel, command) -> "You need the role(s): " + roles + " to use this command!");
```

The `VelenMessage` which was the original first VelenMessage, is used for ratelimit messages which are sent once every ratelimit cycle which means
the bot will only send this message once for each time the user gets ratelimited. The default message is:
```java
Velen.builder().setRatelimitedMessage((remainingSeconds, user, channel, command) -> "You can use this command in **"+remainingSeconds+" seconds**, " +
                                                  "during this period, the bot will not respond to to any invocation of the command: **"+command+"** for the user. " +
                                                  "This message will delete itself when cooldown is over.");
```

## üß∞ Velen Utils
This is a utility class of Velen which you can use as you like to retrieve user mentions, role mentions, channel mentions in their
proper order. Here are all the methods of the utility class:
```java
Collection<Long> : VelenUtils.getOrderedUserMentions(String message);
Collection<Long> : VelenUtils.getOrderedChannelMentions(String message);
Collection<Long> : VelenUtils.getOrderedRoleMentions(String message);
```

## üìõ Velen Command
This is the most amusing part of Velen which takes a lot of inspiration from the library it uses. A VelenCommand is
composed of two parts, the metadata and the event handler which is invoked whenever the command is triggered. A simple
example of a Velen Command is:
```java
VelenCommand.of(
    // The name of the command.
    "hi",

    // The velen instance.
    velen,

    // The event handler which will be invoked if the command is triggered.
    (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hello!"))

  // Attach directly to the Velen instance.
  .attach();

// Short form
VelenCommand.of("hi", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hello!")).attach();
```

The example above will trigger if a user says `v.hi` *or whatever the prefix you are using* and will reply with: `Hello!`
while also using the default cooldown. If you want to change the cooldown, simply add `setCooldown(Duration.ofSeconds(someNumber))`
for example (2 second cooldown):
```java
VelenCommand.of("hi", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hello!"))
                .setCooldown(Duration.ofSeconds(2)).attach();
```

If you want to disable cooldown for the command, simply set the duration to zero like below:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hi", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hello!"))
                .setCooldown(Duration.ofSeconds(0)).attach();
```

Locking a certain command to a certain role:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hello", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hi!"))
                .requireRole(852650686872813569L)
                .attach();
```

Locking a certain command to certain permissions:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hello", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hi!"))
                .requirePermission(PermissionType.MANAGE_CHANNELS)
                .attach();
```

Locking a certain command to only a certain user:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hello", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hi!"))
                .requireUser(584322030934032393L)
                .attach();
```

Setting a description and usage of the command:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hello", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hi!"))
                .setDescription("Say Hello to Velen!")
                .setUsage("hello")
                .attach();
```

After setting the description, in case you need to use it for a help command, you can easily get the command
through the following (this applies to any parameter of a Velen Command):
```java
velen.getCommand("hello").ifPresent(command -> System.out.println(command.getDescription));
```

Additionally, you can set a category which you can retrieve in bulk which is especially handy for help commands:
```java
VelenCommand.of("hello", velen, (event, message, user, arg) -> event.getChannel().sendMessage("Hi!"))
                .setDescription("Say Hello to Velen!")
                .setUsage("hello")
                .setCategory("Miscelleanous")
                .attach();
```

To retrieve in bulk when building a help command, you can do:
```java
velen.getCategory("Miscelleanous");
```
The example above will return a `List<VelenCommand>` which you can then use to grab the name of the command,
description, usage and the category itself.

You can also move the handler to its own class, as seen on the example below:

### ExampleEvent.class
The event handler class, it's exactly similar to Javacord.
```java
class ExampleEvent implements VelenEvent {

        @Override
        public void onEvent(MessageCreateEvent event, Message message, User user, String[] args) {
            event.getMessage().reply("This is inside a class!");
        }

}
```

### Main.class
The main class where you register all your Velen commands.
```java
// This is pretty much the same as the examples above but with the handler on a different class.
VelenCommand.of("hi", velen, new ExampleEvent()).attach();
```

## Velen Pagination
Velen also offers a helper class that helps you paginate items easily with the `Paginate<T>` class, an example
usage can be seen below:
```java
VelenCommand.of("paginate", "Tests pagination.", velen, (event, message, user, args) -> {
  List<String> testList = Arrays.asList("Test 0", "Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3", "Test 4");
  Paginate<String> paginate = new Paginate<>(testList);

  paginate.paginate(event, new PaginateEvent<String>() {

    private EmbedBuilder embed(String currentItem, int arrow, int maximum) {
      // Remember to always add +1 to arrow for these types of stuff since
      // arrow returns the raw position which means it starts at 0 instead of 1.
      return new EmbedBuilder().setTitle("Item [" + (arrow + 1) + "/" + maximum + "]")
        .setDescription(currentItem).setColor(Color.BLUE);
    }

    private EmbedBuilder embed(String currentItem) {
      return new EmbedBuilder().setTitle("Item")
        .setDescription(currentItem).setColor(Color.BLUE);
    }

    @Override
    public MessageBuilder onInit(MessageCreateEvent event, String currentItem,
      int arrow, Paginator<String> paginator) {
      // This is the initial message that will be sent on start of pagination.
      return new MessageBuilder().setEmbed(embed(currentItem, arrow, paginator.size()));
    }

    @Override
    public void onPaginate(MessageCreateEvent event, Message paginateMessage, String currentItem,
      int arrow, Paginator<String> paginator) {
      // This is what will be executed when you paginate next or backwards.
      paginateMessage.edit(embed(currentItem, arrow, paginator.size()));
    }

    @Override
    public MessageBuilder onEmptyPaginator(MessageCreateEvent event) {
      // This is sent when the paginator has no items.
      return new MessageBuilder().setContent("There are currently no items!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onSelect(MessageCreateEvent event, Message paginateMessage, String itemSelected,
      int arrow, Paginator<String> paginator) {
      // Similar to onPaginate except this is sent whenever the user
      // has selected a page that they want.
      paginateMessage.edit(embed(itemSelected));
    }
  }, Duration.ofMinutes(5));
}).attach();
```

Similar to `VelenEvent`, you can also place the handler onto its own class. Refer to the example
of `VelenEvent` but instead of `VelenEvent`, the class should implement `PaginateEvent`.

## üèéÔ∏è How does Velen work?
Velen works through a single monolith listener who then processes each command invocation onto their own
respective commands in a multi-threaded fashion (which means each command is on their own threads) when executed,
similar to a Listener in Javacord (or rather, they are pretty much the same).
